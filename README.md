A simple texture pack that turns the blue dye texture to switzerland because its shaped like switzerland. [Also available on modrinth](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/blue-dye-to-switzerland) and this was created because of [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/JackSucksAtGeography/comments/1dr5g2r/why_does_the_blue_dye_in_minecraft_look_like/) (I am u/EightBitPlayz)
